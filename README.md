Hello there, I’m @CharlesDahl (15 y/o) 👋

- Currently I'm mainly working in C++ 🤓
- I also program in Python when I have to (not a fan of snakes 🐍)
- I'm learning advanced topics in C++, data structures and algorithms 👨‍💻
- I'm interested in all kinds of things like web development, game development 🎮, databases, desktop applications...
- This summer 🌞 I got an internship where I'm coding projects in Python and having a blast 💥
- After expanding my horizons 🦅, I'm planning to learn a bit about game development in Pygame (engines are too complicated for me)
- I will try to be somewhat active on this site, but I can't guarantee it 😥

Bye and always have fun programming 👋
